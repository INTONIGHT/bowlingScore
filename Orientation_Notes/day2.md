#Day 2 Notes
### File System
How files are named,stored and accessed
tree like
root top level directory(folder)
- nested inside
-in unix the root is represented by `\`
in windows = `C:\`
- not every user will have access to entire file system.
### Paths
- when it can be represented as a tree refered to as **paths**
**Absolute path** : "measured from the root directory or globaly fixed point
`C:\Programs\Java\`
in linux `/users/revature/documents/text.txt`
**Relative Paths**
measured from the location of another file or directory relative to another point. 
`../styles/stylesheet.css`
`.` ->  represernts the current directory
`..` -> represents the parent directory
> subdirectories are divided by the `/`
GUI the user files.
